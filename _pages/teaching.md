## Student supervision

Research mentoring includes an MSc student and undergraduate researchers in CI/CD security, container security, identity and authorisation, topic modelling, and tamper-evident evidence. I have also supervised fourth-year software project teams.

<small>Appointments and planned courses should be periodically rechecked.</small>
